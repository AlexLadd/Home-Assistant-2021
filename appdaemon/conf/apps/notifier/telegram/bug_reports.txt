2021-02-09, 18:37:33 Alex: this is a new bug report 1

2021-02-09, 22:27:31 Alex: turn off all lights doesn't get every light. Also some lights are not picked up in AD even though they are in HA
  -> DONEish - Sometime AD does not pick up lights when HA is restart... there isnt much that can be done right now without a restart

2021-02-14, 22:09:52 Stephanie: lights didn't turn off when steph went to bed
  -> FIXED - turn_light_on controller class was missing transition parameter to turn_light_off in light class

2021-02-16, 04:23:05 Stephanie: laundry room and pantry light were dim
  -> POTENTIAL FIX: FEB 20: Lots of little light bug fixes

2021-02-16, 04:23:06 Alex: Master fan didn't turn off when first person set to asleep
  -> FIXED - turn_light_on controller class was missing transition parameter to turn_light_off in light class

2021-02-16, 04:23:06 Stephanie: bed lamps did not turn on
  -> FIXED - Sleep being on took priority over manual adjustments

2021-02-16, 04:23:06 Alex: bedside lamps have brightness of 0 when we are asleep
  -> FIXED - Sleep being on took priority over manual adjustments

2021-03-04, 08:39:11 Alex: morning message boolean didn't turn on when both set awake upstairs and message played
  -> STALE - To much has changed in this system for this to be relavent

2021-03-05, 06:03:10 Alex: when both set awake Master bedroom and bathroom light turned off
  -> NOT_SURE - Maybe just a coincidence? How was master bedroom on when asleep to begin with??

2021-03-05, 23:58:26 Stephanie: master bathroom ceiling light did not turn off when we were both set to asleep
  -> FIXED - master_bathroom_light is a dimable switch so was not caught in lights.turn_all_off() call

2021-03-07, 18:55:39 Alex: there is a mistake with a living_room_fan_light turn off call. Not is the light module most likely but perhaps the call is spelling the name wrong
  -> SHOULD_BE_FIXED - Added living_room_fan_light to living_room_fan aliases

2021-03-08, 21:58:46 Stephanie: outdoor temp was -1 and we were both set to sleep and nothing was said about it in the tts message (both set to sleep at the same time)
  -> SEE BUG REPORT 3 OR 4 BELOW THIS

2021-03-08, 21:59:12 Stephanie: sleep message talked about manual hvac message twice
  -> FIXED - Split up climate_check & boolean_check into TTS & Telegram messages so the HVAC does repeat and the booleans don't need to be TTS message anyways...

2021-03-09, 09:01:19 Alex: security monitoring turn on when last person leaves but it is detecting someone home and awake when they have already left
  -> FIXED - Changed security_monitoring check from self.anyone_home() to self.presence.occupancy

2021-03-09, 09:02:06 Alex: an app is trying to use a speaker called "night" - potentially the alarm or security app
  -> FIXED - speakers.set_volume() had a set_volume('night') call built into it... it was removed

2021-03-09, 21:15:15 Stephanie: master bedroom window was open and the goodnight message did not say anything
  -> FIXED - this was working okay (manual HVAC mode was on so the windows were not being checked the same way) but added in a redundent check when in this state

2021-03-10, 09:56:57 Alex: home armed away when I was home. Person.alex said I was away but life360 said I was at home all day...
  -> FIXED - person.alex wasn't using alex_phone_wifi but is now

2021-03-10, 19:02:46 Stephanie: when the living room tv is on, the lamps should be brighter
  -> FIXED - Changed brightness from 20 to 35

2021-03-10, 19:03:04 Stephanie: dining room light turning on dim.... WHY?????????????????????????????

2021-03-11, 08:27:54 Alex: tts played when we were both asleep last night
  -> FIXED - this was actually the bathroom speaker not the master bedroom but it was removed when asleep

2021-03-11, 08:28:26 Alex: fix door open for 5 minutes message. Remove raw sensor from tts message
  -> FIXED - removed the raw sensor string from tts message

2021-03-11, 20:54:17 Stephanie: buttons did not work to go to sleep
  -> FIXED - BUG in SC Module from yesterday and it was not running over nights since the bug was missed

2021-03-14, 11:32:25 Stephanie: when good night message plays, check doors and send message to say what doors are open
  -> THERE WAS AN ERROR IN THE CONTROLLER THAT MAY HAVE CAUSED THIS...

2021-03-14, 21:24:28 Alex: nightly notify did not read Temps correctly. Remove the checks? Use alternative weather app?
  -> FIXED - Removed blocking pws_check() in climate_check() from message app

2021-03-15, 14:19:35 Alex: alarm doesn't arm when last person leaves home but security_monitoring turns on
  -> ADDED SOME LOGGING HERE TO HELP

2021-03-16, 16:25:37 Alex: first person awake tts played upatairs
  -> FIXED - emergency_mode was on since the turn off call wasnt called when the alarm went from triggered -> not triggered

2021-03-16, 21:37:57 Stephanie: good night message says good morning
  -> FIXED - the SC module notify_title was "Good Morning"

2021-03-17, 21:31:14 Stephanie: emergency mode is not turning off
  -> FIXED - Error in security module turn_off_emergency_mode() line 248 that was fixed

2021-03-23, 21:10:50 Stephanie: music did not play when I got home
  -> RESOLVED - Spotify changed the API and is not working at the moment - using spotcast for now...

2021-03-28, 12:32:40 Alex: speakers use_group does not change appropriate speakers to the corresponding group

2021-03-28, 12:33:36 Alex: precip chance was different in the message than it was in the pws sensor

2021-04-01, 05:41:31 Stephanie: living room fan and lamps were on this morning but they should have turned off when we went to sleep

2021-04-02, 21:39:22 Stephanie: master closet light via  motion not disabled when both asleep
  -> FIXED - light will NOT turn on when someone is asleep

2021-04-04, 11:47:14 Stephanie: alex and Steph person leaving home are off by almost 10 minutes

2021-04-04, 11:49:30 Stephanie: when last person leaves home, call arm alarm in the security app before calling the security monitoring loop to prevent the initial warning message being sent
  -> SHOULD BE FIXED - changed start_offset to 15 seconds after the last person leaves home

2021-04-08, 12:16:29 Stephanie: the watching tv lights are on while it's light outside

2021-04-16, 17:40:31 Stephanie: car port camera isn't working likely because the IP address has changed since setting it up
  -> FIXED - changed config IP and made it static in unifi controller

2021-04-18, 21:22:52 Alex: sonoff rf bridges are only working periodically. Appears to be the same issue as before... when it has too many sensors it stops working. This is only a hypothesis. Try using one device such as an esp32 or pi
  -> SELF FIXED - resolved itself somehow...

2021-05-07, 16:29:03 Alex: add in notifications and household alarm when smoke detectors are triggered. Also build in a regular notification to Alex/Steph to test the alarms.
  -> PARTIALLY_DONE - added notification when alarm triggers - need to add in repeats

2021-05-07, 16:29:03 Stephanie: laundry room and pantry lights turn on dim
  -> NOT FIXED - part of a larger problem of many lights turning on to the wrong brightness level

2021-05-08, 10:00:25 Stephanie: fireplace should turn off when we go to bed
  -> ADDED - Should now be added to the house_lockdown sequence of events - not exhuastively tested yet though...

2021-05-09, 21:54:00 Stephanie: master bedroom light did not turn on with motion, neither did the upstairs stairwell
  -> FIXED/FOUND - dark_mode was not turned on this night... the root cause for this was not found

2021-05-09, 22:36:20 Stephanie: change the hue component scan interval to one second
  -> DONE - change scan_interval to 1 second

2021-05-17, 22:13:22 Stephanie: when both of us are asleep, the message should say what doors are open (ie master bedroom outside door). 
  -> DONE- added to night_notify for each person when going to sleep in sleep controller

The master bedroom outside door notification should be disabled during the day when someone is home.
  -> DONE - Added sensor to both door and screen
2021-06-21, 07:33:25 Stephanie: precipitation forecast was wrong on morning message
